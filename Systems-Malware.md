System Programming Roadmap

A roadmap to teach myself compiler dev, malware reverse engineering and kernel dev fundamentals. To be noted they are only for the fundamental knowledge and doesn't make you a master of any. I will pick one or more of the below mentioned fields for later research in some specific topics. Low Level Programming University also has a good list of resources to follow but this is my personal roadmap.

Topics to study here may or may not be in order and can be studied according to your preference, gievn that prerequisites are getting fulfilled for each one of them.
Prerequisites

I'm already assuming that you have basic understanding of computer architecture and experience with atleast one system programming language, some basics of how assembly works and familiar using any POSIX system. A good detailed look of how computers work at the electronics level can be found in the book Introduction to Digital Electronics by Agner Fog. And for the software equivalent work you can refer to cpu.land.
System Programming Languages

Learn any two of the given languages, make some basic projects to get yourself familiar with it, solve some programming exercises.

    C
    Rust
    Learn C++, C++ reference
    C++ (video)

Learn some Computer Architecture

Learn Arm and RISCV based computer architecture to build an efficient and optimized approach towards solving the problems at hardware level

    David A. Patterson, John L. Hennessy "Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach"
    David A. Patterson, John L. Hennessy "Computer Organization and Design ARM Edition"
    David A. Patterson, John L. Hennessy "Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition"
    John Paul Shen, Mikko H. Lipasti "Modern Processor Design: Fundamentals of Superscalar Processors"
    CMU Computer Architecture by CMU Youtube

Learn some Assembly

Prerequisites: Learn about Digital Logic

If you are not familiar with assembly yet, I would recommend checking out some tutorials like-

    x86 quickstart[MASM]
    x86 quickstart [NASM]
    ASM Tutor[NASM]
    Introduction to x86 assembly language by Davy on youtube
    OMU x86_64 lessons
    The Art Of Asm
    Intel x64 manuals
    Compiler Explorer: Making C programs and reading the disassembly always helps to match patterns.
    Article by 0x41 reversing for dummies to be able to reverse basic crackmes.

After this, I would recommend solving easy crackmes for exercise. crackmes.one and tryhackme are places to find some of the easy ones. Hard ones still require some pwning knowledge which I'm gona discuss in the exploitation section.
Compilers

Prerequisites include experience creating projects in a system programming language and a deep understanding of memory and CPU.

    Read the Dragon Book.
    Crafting Interpreters is a good one for beginners.
    Language Implementation Patterns provides some good insights on the workings of compilers.
    Stanford Notes CS143 Good assignments and notes related to compiler design.
    CMU slides and Projects
    Awesome Compilers
    Make a Language in Rust
    Rust Parsing Basics
    Make a tree walk interpreted programming language.
    Also try to implement a bytecode engine for your interpreter, try out some optimizations and GC.
    You can also emulate machines like Chip8 or Nes.
        Emulation requires knowledge of VM internals and graphics programming.
        You can use SDL as an IO/graphics/sound engine.
    Try to make a compiled programming language targetting one architecture.
    Learn about the LLVM toolchain
    LLVM tutorial in Rust
    Try to follow the llvm tutorial to make your first programming language using llvm backend.
    Try to make a Just In Time Compiler around the bytecode engine, detect hot regions and JIT them.
